## Student Information
- **Name:** Omaatla Kgosinkwe
- **Student Number:** st10497107@rcconect.edu.za

## Project Overview
**Organization Overview:**  
BloomMind makes mental health support accessible to all students, especially those facing pressures of school or personal life. It was founded in February 2025 by a group of passionate students and mental health advocates. It began as a small project based in the school premises of Rosebank College, Braamfontein to help peers track their moods and find trustworthy people without stigma or judgment.  

**Mission and Vision Statements:**  
A world where no student feels alone in their struggles. Where taking care of your mental health is normal, safe, and judgment-free. Not a taboo!  

**Target Audience:**  
Students who are distressed and need a safe space to talk.  

**Current Website Analysis:**  
BloomMind currently does not have a running website. This means the organization is missing out on potential worldwide outreach and cannot assist as many young people as possible. Without an online presence, potential sponsors are unaware of BloomMind, which is essential for scaling the organization.
