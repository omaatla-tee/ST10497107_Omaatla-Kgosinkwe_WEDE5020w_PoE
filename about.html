    <h1>About Bloom Mind</h1>

    <p>
        Bloom Mind began in February 2025 as a simple idea between a few students who understood how heavy
        school pressure can feel. What started as informal check-ins and honest conversations between classmates
         slowly grew into something much bigger.
    </p>

    <p>
        We realised that students needed a safe space, a place where they could talk freely about stress,
        anxiety, burnout, and personal challenges without shame. So Bloom Mind was created to fill that gap.
        From those early days in a small study room, the project expanded into a student-led mental wellness
        network that now reaches students from different campuses and backgrounds.
    </p>

    <p>
        Today, Bloom Mind continues to grow as a trusted community. We offer peer support, workshops,
        stress-relief activities, and practical resources designed to help students understand themselves better.
        Our goal is simple: to remind every student that they deserve peace, support, and a chance to breathe —
        no matter what they are going through.

    <h2>Mission Statement</h2>
    <p>
        Our mission is to create a world where no student feels alone in their struggles. We aim to make
        mental health support normal, safe, and stigma-free — just like asking for help with schoolwork.
        Through genuine connection, accessible support, and judgment-free spaces, we hope to give students the
        confidence to take care of their minds and grow in both academics and life.
    </p>

    <h2>Vision Statement</h2>
    <p>
        We envision becoming South Africa’s leading student-focused mental health network. Our dream is to
        build a generation that sees mental wellness as a strength, not a weakness. We want to bring mental
        health resources into everyday student life, making every campus a supportive environment where
        students can thrive without fear or shame.
