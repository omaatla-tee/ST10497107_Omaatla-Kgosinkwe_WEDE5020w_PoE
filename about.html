    <h2>A Bit About Us</h2>

    <p>
        Bloom Mind was founded in February 2025 by a group of passionate students and mental health
         advocates. It began as a small project on the school premises of Rosebank College, Braamfontein,
         aiming to help peers track their moods and connect with trustworthy people without stigma or 
         judgment. What started as casual peer check-ins soon grew into a safe, supportive network for 
         students from all walks of life. Today, Bloom Mind continues to create a space where openness 
         about mental health is encouraged, and where every student feels understood, valued, and supported 
         in their journey toward wellness.
    </p>

<h2>Mission Statement</h2>

<p>
    To create a world where no student feels alone in their struggles where caring for mental health 
    is as normal, safe, and stigma-free as asking for academic help. We believe in providing judgment-free 
    spaces, accessible support, and genuine community so students can find the help they need and thrive in 
    both mind and spirit.
</p>

 <h2>Vision Statement</h2>
<p>
    Our vision is to be the leading student-focused mental health network in South Africa, empowering 
    young people to take control of their wellbeing without fear or shame. We aim to foster a generation 
    where mental health care is integrated into everyday student life, celebrated as an act of strength, 
    and supported by compassionate communities across all campuses.
